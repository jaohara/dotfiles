# Note About `.nanorc` and `.vimrc`

Each of these files should be symlinked from the home directory with `ln -s ~/.dotfiles/.vimrc ~/.vimrc`. 

`.vimrc` depends on powerline and has the location hardcoded in. Before you make your symlinkyou should make sure that you install powerline and edit `.vimrc` to point to the proper path on the system.
